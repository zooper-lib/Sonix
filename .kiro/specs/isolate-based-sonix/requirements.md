# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the Sonix audio waveform library from a singleton-based static API to an instantiable, isolate-based architecture. The primary goal is to ensure that audio processing never blocks the UI thread while providing the simplest possible API for users who only need waveform data for visualization purposes. The library will maintain all existing functionality while adding true background processing capabilities and a more flexible, object-oriented interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to create multiple Sonix instances with different configurations, so that I can handle different audio processing scenarios in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new Sonix instance THEN the system SHALL allow me to provide custom configuration parameters
2. WHEN I create multiple Sonix instances THEN each instance SHALL maintain its own independent configuration and state
3. WHEN I dispose of a Sonix instance THEN the system SHALL clean up all resources associated with that specific instance
4. IF I don't provide configuration parameters THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values
5. WHEN I create a Sonix instance THEN the system SHALL initialize all necessary isolate infrastructure automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want all audio processing to happen in background isolates, so that my UI remains responsive during waveform generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call any waveform generation method THEN the system SHALL execute all audio decoding and processing in a background isolate
2. WHEN audio processing is running THEN the main UI thread SHALL remain completely unblocked
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL return results to the main isolate safely
4. IF an error occurs in the background isolate THEN the system SHALL propagate the error to the main isolate with proper error handling
5. WHEN multiple processing requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them concurrently without blocking each other

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want a simple API that focuses on waveform data generation, so that I can easily integrate audio visualization without dealing with complex audio processing details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I want to generate a waveform THEN the system SHALL provide a simple method that takes a file path and returns waveform data
2. WHEN I need progress updates THEN the system SHALL provide optional progress callbacks without complicating the basic API
3. WHEN I want to customize waveform generation THEN the system SHALL accept optional configuration parameters
4. IF I don't need the raw audio data THEN the system SHALL not expose it in the primary API
5. WHEN I call waveform generation methods THEN the system SHALL return only the data needed for visualization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility with existing code, so that I can migrate gradually without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing code uses the static Sonix API THEN the system SHALL continue to work without modifications
2. WHEN I migrate to the new instance-based API THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent functionality
3. WHEN I use the new API THEN the system SHALL provide better performance through isolate-based processing
4. IF I use deprecated static methods THEN the system SHALL show appropriate deprecation warnings
5. WHEN I follow migration guidelines THEN the system SHALL provide a clear path from static to instance-based usage

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want automatic resource management, so that I don't have to manually manage isolates and memory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a Sonix instance THEN the system SHALL automatically set up required background isolates
2. WHEN processing is idle THEN the system SHALL automatically manage isolate lifecycle to conserve resources
3. WHEN I dispose of a Sonix instance THEN the system SHALL automatically clean up all associated isolates and resources
4. IF memory pressure is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically optimize resource usage
5. WHEN the application terminates THEN the system SHALL gracefully shut down all background processing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want streaming waveform generation with progress updates, so that I can provide real-time feedback for large file processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I process large audio files THEN the system SHALL provide streaming waveform data as it becomes available
2. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL emit progress updates with percentage completion
3. WHEN I receive streaming data THEN the system SHALL deliver it from the background isolate without blocking the UI
4. IF I want to cancel processing THEN the system SHALL provide a way to stop the background operation
5. WHEN streaming completes THEN the system SHALL provide a final completion notification

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want efficient caching and memory management across isolates, so that repeated operations are fast and memory usage is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I process the same file multiple times THEN the system SHALL cache results across isolate boundaries
2. WHEN cache data is needed in a background isolate THEN the system SHALL efficiently transfer cached data
3. WHEN memory limits are reached THEN the system SHALL automatically evict least recently used cache entries
4. IF cached data becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it
5. WHEN I query cache statistics THEN the system SHALL provide accurate information across all isolates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want comprehensive error handling that works across isolate boundaries, so that I can handle failures gracefully in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in a background isolate THEN the system SHALL properly serialize and transfer the error to the main isolate
2. WHEN I receive an error THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about what went wrong and where
3. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL clean up any partial state and resources
4. IF a background isolate crashes THEN the system SHALL detect this and provide appropriate error information
5. WHEN I handle errors THEN the system SHALL provide the same exception types as the current API for consistency
