# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will overhaul the existing audio library to implement chunked decoding as the standard approach for ALL audio files, regardless of size. Instead of loading entire audio files into memory for waveform generation, the system will always process audio in configurable chunks. This fundamental change will provide consistent memory usage, better performance, and scalability from small files to files larger than 10GB. This enhancement will work across all supported audio formats (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG) and provide seamless integration with the existing waveform generation system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want ALL audio files to be processed using chunked decoding, so that my application has consistent memory usage and performance regardless of file size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any audio file THEN the system SHALL always decode in chunks, never loading the entire file
2. WHEN processing audio files of any size THEN the system SHALL maintain a maximum memory footprint of configurable size (default 100MB)
3. WHEN decoding chunks THEN the system SHALL never load more than the specified chunk size into memory
4. WHEN processing small files (under 10MB) THEN the system SHALL still use chunked processing for consistency
5. WHEN chunk processing completes THEN the system SHALL immediately release chunk memory before processing the next chunk
6. WHEN multiple files are processed concurrently THEN the system SHALL respect memory limits for each operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want configurable chunk sizes for audio processing, so that I can optimize memory usage based on my application's constraints and target devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring chunk size THEN the system SHALL accept values from 1MB to 100MB
2. WHEN chunk size is not specified THEN the system SHALL use a default of 10MB
3. WHEN chunk size is too small THEN the system SHALL warn about potential performance impact
4. WHEN chunk size is too large for available memory THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce to a safe size
5. WHEN processing different file formats THEN the system SHALL allow format-specific chunk size optimization
6. WHEN device memory is limited THEN the system SHALL provide memory-aware chunk size recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want chunked decoding to work seamlessly across all supported audio formats, so that I don't need format-specific handling in my application code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any MP3 file THEN the system SHALL decode in chunks respecting MP3 frame boundaries
2. WHEN processing any FLAC file THEN the system SHALL decode in chunks respecting FLAC block boundaries
3. WHEN processing any WAV file THEN the system SHALL decode in chunks with proper sample alignment
4. WHEN processing any OGG file THEN the system SHALL decode in chunks respecting OGG page boundaries
5. WHEN chunk boundaries don't align with format structures THEN the system SHALL handle boundaries correctly without audio artifacts
6. WHEN switching between formats THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt chunking strategy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want efficient seeking within any audio file, so that I can generate waveforms for specific sections without processing the entire file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN seeking to a specific time position THEN the system SHALL jump directly to that location without decoding preceding audio
2. WHEN seeking within a chunk THEN the system SHALL provide sub-chunk positioning accuracy
3. WHEN seeking to positions near chunk boundaries THEN the system SHALL handle boundary conditions correctly
4. WHEN seeking repeatedly THEN the system SHALL maintain efficient performance without memory accumulation
5. WHEN seeking in compressed formats THEN the system SHALL handle format-specific seeking limitations gracefully
6. WHEN seeking fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error information and fallback to sequential processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want progress feedback during file processing, so that I can provide meaningful progress indicators to users for any file size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any audio file THEN the system SHALL provide progress callbacks with percentage completion
2. WHEN chunk processing completes THEN the system SHALL report the number of chunks processed and remaining
3. WHEN processing time estimates are available THEN the system SHALL provide estimated time remaining
4. WHEN processing speed varies THEN the system SHALL update progress estimates dynamically
5. WHEN processing is cancelled THEN the system SHALL immediately stop and report final progress state
6. WHEN errors occur during processing THEN the system SHALL report progress up to the error point

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want robust error handling during chunked processing, so that partial failures don't prevent processing of the remaining audio data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a single chunk fails to decode THEN the system SHALL continue processing subsequent chunks
2. WHEN chunk processing errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information including chunk position and size
3. WHEN multiple consecutive chunks fail THEN the system SHALL abort processing and report the failure pattern
4. WHEN recoverable errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic retry with adjusted parameters
5. WHEN file corruption is detected in a chunk THEN the system SHALL skip the corrupted section and continue
6. WHEN processing is interrupted THEN the system SHALL provide resumption capabilities from the last successful chunk

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want chunked processing to integrate seamlessly with existing waveform generation, so that I don't need to change my current implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing waveform generation APIs THEN the system SHALL automatically use chunked processing for large files
2. WHEN generating waveforms from chunks THEN the system SHALL produce identical results to full-file processing
3. WHEN waveform resolution is specified THEN the system SHALL distribute resolution evenly across all chunks
4. WHEN combining chunk results THEN the system SHALL maintain waveform continuity and accuracy
5. WHEN existing code calls waveform generation THEN the system SHALL work without code changes
6. WHEN streaming waveform generation is used THEN the system SHALL provide chunk-based streaming updates

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want memory-efficient chunk processing that works on resource-constrained devices, so that my application performs well across all target platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running on low-memory devices THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust chunk sizes to available memory
2. WHEN memory pressure is detected THEN the system SHALL reduce chunk size or pause processing
3. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL queue operations to prevent memory exhaustion
4. WHEN background processing occurs THEN the system SHALL yield to the UI thread regularly
5. WHEN device capabilities vary THEN the system SHALL adapt processing parameters automatically
6. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and automatic mitigation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want comprehensive testing of chunked processing functionality, so that I can rely on the feature's stability across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing chunked processing THEN the system SHALL include tests for files ranging from small (1MB) to very large (10GB+)
2. WHEN testing different formats THEN the system SHALL verify chunked processing works correctly for MP3, FLAC, WAV, and OGG
3. WHEN testing chunk boundaries THEN the system SHALL verify no audio artifacts or data loss occurs
4. WHEN testing memory usage THEN the system SHALL verify memory stays within configured limits for all file sizes
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify graceful handling of corrupted chunks and I/O errors
6. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL verify chunked processing performance is consistent across all file sizes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want clear documentation and examples for chunked processing configuration, so that I can optimize the feature for my specific use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on chunk size selection
2. WHEN implementing chunked processing THEN the system SHALL include code examples for common scenarios
3. WHEN troubleshooting performance THEN the system SHALL provide debugging and profiling guidance
4. WHEN configuring for different platforms THEN the system SHALL include platform-specific recommendations
5. WHEN migrating existing code THEN the system SHALL provide migration guides and compatibility information
