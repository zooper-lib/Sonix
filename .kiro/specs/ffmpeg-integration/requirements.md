# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Sonix Flutter package from its current native audio libraries (minimp3, dr_wav, dr_flac, stb_vorbis, libopus) to FFMPEG while maintaining MIT licensing compatibility. The migration requires building FFMPEG with LGPL licensing for all supported platforms and providing automated build scripts for end users to generate the necessary binaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Sonix package, I want the library to use FFMPEG for audio processing so that I can benefit from more robust and comprehensive audio format support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library processes audio files THEN it SHALL use FFMPEG libraries instead of the current native decoders
2. WHEN FFMPEG processes audio THEN the system SHALL maintain the same isolate-based architecture for non-blocking UI performance
3. WHEN audio processing occurs THEN the system SHALL support all currently supported formats (MP3, OGG, WAV, FLAC, Opus) through FFMPEG

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want to maintain MIT licensing compatibility while using FFMPEG so that the package remains legally compliant and usable in commercial projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FFMPEG is integrated THEN the system SHALL build FFMPEG with LGPL licensing only
2. WHEN the package is distributed THEN it SHALL NOT include FFMPEG source code or binaries
3. WHEN licensing is evaluated THEN the package SHALL maintain its MIT license status
4. WHEN FFMPEG binaries are used THEN they SHALL be dynamically linked to comply with LGPL requirements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user of the Sonix package, I want an automated way to build FFMPEG binaries so that I can easily set up the library for testing and development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs FFMPEG binaries THEN the system SHALL provide automated build scripts for all supported platforms
2. WHEN the build script runs THEN it SHALL download FFMPEG source code from official sources
3. WHEN FFMPEG is built THEN the system SHALL configure it with LGPL-compatible options only
4. WHEN binaries are generated THEN they SHALL be automatically copied to the correct platform-specific locations
5. WHEN the build process completes THEN the system SHALL verify that binaries are correctly placed and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the FFMPEG integration to work across all supported platforms so that cross-platform compatibility is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FFMPEG is built THEN it SHALL generate platform-specific binaries (.dll for Windows, .dylib for macOS, .so for Linux/Android)
2. WHEN the library runs on Android THEN it SHALL use FFMPEG libraries compatible with Android NDK
3. WHEN the library runs on iOS THEN it SHALL use FFMPEG libraries compatible with iOS SDK
4. WHEN the library runs on desktop platforms THEN it SHALL use appropriate FFMPEG libraries for Windows, macOS, and Linux
5. WHEN platform detection occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically load the correct FFMPEG binary for the current platform

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the Sonix API, I want the FFMPEG migration to be transparent so that existing code continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FFMPEG integration is complete THEN the existing SonixInstance API SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN legacy static Sonix API is used THEN it SHALL continue to function with FFMPEG backend
3. WHEN audio processing methods are called THEN they SHALL return the same data structures and formats as before
4. WHEN error handling occurs THEN it SHALL maintain the same exception types and error messages where possible
5. WHEN performance characteristics are measured THEN they SHALL be equal to or better than the current implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure FFMPEG integration works correctly so that I can trust the library's reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify FFMPEG integration for all supported audio formats
2. WHEN isolate processing is tested THEN it SHALL confirm FFMPEG works correctly in background isolates
3. WHEN memory management is tested THEN it SHALL verify proper cleanup of FFMPEG resources
4. WHEN error conditions are tested THEN they SHALL validate proper FFMPEG error handling and reporting
5. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL compare FFMPEG performance against previous benchmarks
6. WHEN integration tests execute THEN they SHALL use real audio files to validate end-to-end functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a package maintainer, I want clear documentation and build instructions so that contributors and users can understand the FFMPEG integration process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include step-by-step FFMPEG build instructions for each platform
2. WHEN build scripts are documented THEN they SHALL explain all configuration options and dependencies
3. WHEN licensing information is provided THEN it SHALL clearly explain LGPL compliance and MIT compatibility
4. WHEN troubleshooting guides are created THEN they SHALL address common FFMPEG build and integration issues
5. WHEN API documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect any changes in behavior due to FFMPEG integration
