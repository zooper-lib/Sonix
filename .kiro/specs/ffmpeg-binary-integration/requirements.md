# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves completely overhauling the FFMPEG integration in the Sonix Flutter package by removing all existing stubs and mock implementations, requiring users to provide proper FFMPEG binaries, and creating a robust native wrapper with comprehensive unit tests. The implementation must eliminate any dependency on automatic FFMPEG building and instead rely on user-provided binaries while ensuring 100% functional integration without any stubs or mocks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the Sonix package, I want to provide my own FFMPEG binaries so that I have full control over the FFMPEG version and configuration used by the library.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library initializes THEN it SHALL require user-provided FFMPEG binaries (avformat, avcodec, avutil, swresample)
2. WHEN FFMPEG binaries are missing THEN the system SHALL fail with clear error messages indicating which binaries are required
3. WHEN valid FFMPEG binaries are provided THEN the system SHALL use them for all audio processing operations
4. WHEN the system loads FFMPEG binaries THEN it SHALL verify they contain the required symbols and functions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing FFMPEG stubs and mock implementations completely removed so that the library only works with real FFMPEG binaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is examined THEN it SHALL contain no stub implementations for FFMPEG functions
2. WHEN the codebase is examined THEN it SHALL contain no mock FFMPEG implementations in tests
3. WHEN FFMPEG binaries are not available THEN the system SHALL fail immediately rather than falling back to stubs
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL use real FFMPEG binaries and real audio processing
5. WHEN the native wrapper is built THEN it SHALL only compile with actual FFMPEG libraries present

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to download and use pre-built FFMPEG binaries so that I don't need to build FFMPEG from source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need FFMPEG binaries THEN the system SHALL provide a script to download pre-built binaries from a reliable source
2. WHEN the download script runs THEN it SHALL fetch platform-specific FFMPEG binaries (Windows: DLLs, macOS: dylibs, Linux: shared objects)
3. WHEN binaries are downloaded THEN they SHALL be placed in the correct native platform directories
4. WHEN download completes THEN the system SHALL verify binary integrity and compatibility
5. WHEN binaries are invalid or incompatible THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with resolution steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust native wrapper that properly integrates with FFMPEG libraries so that all audio processing functions work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the native wrapper is called THEN it SHALL properly initialize FFMPEG contexts and handle all memory management
2. WHEN audio decoding occurs THEN the wrapper SHALL use FFMPEG's avformat, avcodec, and swresample libraries correctly
3. WHEN format detection is performed THEN the wrapper SHALL use FFMPEG's probing capabilities accurately
4. WHEN chunked processing is used THEN the wrapper SHALL handle FFMPEG contexts across multiple chunks without memory leaks
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the wrapper SHALL translate FFMPEG error codes to meaningful Sonix error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests that validate the FFMPEG wrapper functionality so that I can trust the integration is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL test all FFMPEG wrapper functions with real audio files
2. WHEN format detection tests run THEN they SHALL verify correct identification of MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, and MP4 formats using real file headers
3. WHEN audio decoding tests run THEN they SHALL verify correct sample extraction and format conversion using real FFMPEG libraries
4. WHEN chunked processing tests run THEN they SHALL verify proper handling of large files and memory management
5. WHEN error handling tests run THEN they SHALL verify proper error translation and resource cleanup
6. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear diagnostic information about what went wrong

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the FFMPEG integration to work across all supported platforms so that cross-platform compatibility is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library runs on Windows THEN it SHALL load and use FFMPEG DLL files correctly
2. WHEN the library runs on macOS THEN it SHALL load and use FFMPEG dylib files correctly  
3. WHEN the library runs on Linux THEN it SHALL load and use FFMPEG shared object files correctly
4. WHEN platform detection occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically load the correct FFMPEG binary for the current platform
5. WHEN binaries are missing for a platform THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to obtain them

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using the Sonix API, I want the FFMPEG integration to be transparent so that existing code continues to work without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the FFMPEG integration is complete THEN the existing SonixInstance API SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN legacy static Sonix API is used THEN it SHALL continue to function with FFMPEG backend
3. WHEN audio processing methods are called THEN they SHALL return the same data structures and formats as before
4. WHEN error handling occurs THEN it SHALL maintain the same exception types and error messages where possible
5. WHEN performance characteristics are measured THEN they SHALL be equal to or better than the current implementation
