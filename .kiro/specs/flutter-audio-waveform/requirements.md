# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This Flutter package will provide audio waveform generation and visualization capabilities similar to SoundCloud's waveform display. The package will support multiple audio formats (MP3, OGG, WAV, FLAC, and others) without relying on FFMPEG, using alternative decoding libraries instead. It will offer extensive customization options for waveform display, memory-efficient processing, and real-time playback position visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to generate waveform data from audio files in common formats, so that I can visualize audio content in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audio file in MP3 format is provided THEN the system SHALL decode and generate waveform data
2. WHEN an audio file in OGG format is provided THEN the system SHALL decode and generate waveform data
3. WHEN an audio file in WAV format is provided THEN the system SHALL decode and generate waveform data
4. WHEN an audio file in FLAC format is provided THEN the system SHALL decode and generate waveform data
5. WHEN an unsupported audio format is provided THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
6. WHEN audio decoding fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to use native C audio decoding libraries instead of FFMPEG, so that I can achieve optimal performance without heavy dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is integrated THEN the system SHALL NOT require FFMPEG installation
2. WHEN audio decoding is performed THEN the system SHALL use native C libraries through Dart FFI
3. WHEN the package is imported THEN the system SHALL work without additional heavy setup steps
4. WHEN multiple audio formats are processed THEN the system SHALL use MIT-compatible C libraries (minimp3, dr_flac, dr_wav, stb_vorbis, libopus)
5. WHEN the package is built THEN the system SHALL compile native libraries for all target platforms
6. WHEN using native libraries THEN the system SHALL maintain MIT license compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want extensive customization options for waveform display, so that I can match my application's design requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN customizing waveform appearance THEN the system SHALL allow color modification
2. WHEN customizing waveform appearance THEN the system SHALL allow height adjustment
3. WHEN customizing waveform appearance THEN the system SHALL allow width adjustment
4. WHEN customizing waveform appearance THEN the system SHALL allow bar spacing modification
5. WHEN customizing waveform appearance THEN the system SHALL allow gradient effects
6. WHEN customizing waveform appearance THEN the system SHALL allow different visualization styles
7. WHEN customizing waveform appearance THEN the system SHALL allow amplitude scaling options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to access raw waveform data values, so that I can implement custom visualizations or perform additional processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN waveform generation is complete THEN the system SHALL provide access to raw amplitude values
2. WHEN requesting waveform data THEN the system SHALL return values in a standardized format
3. WHEN accessing waveform data THEN the system SHALL provide metadata about sample rate and duration
4. WHEN waveform data is requested THEN the system SHALL allow different resolution levels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to display current audio playback position on the waveform, so that users can see playback progress like in SoundCloud.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a playback position (double) is provided THEN the system SHALL highlight the played portion
2. WHEN playback position updates THEN the system SHALL update the visual representation in real-time
3. WHEN displaying playback progress THEN the system SHALL show played portion in one color
4. WHEN displaying playback progress THEN the system SHALL show unplayed portion in a different color/style
5. WHEN playback position is at the beginning THEN the system SHALL show the entire waveform as unplayed
6. WHEN playback position is at the end THEN the system SHALL show the entire waveform as played

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want the package to be memory efficient, so that my application performs well even with large audio files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large audio files THEN the system SHALL minimize memory usage
2. WHEN generating waveforms THEN the system SHALL use streaming processing where possible
3. WHEN multiple waveforms are displayed THEN the system SHALL efficiently manage memory allocation
4. WHEN waveform data is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of resources
5. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL avoid loading entire files into memory simultaneously

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want fast waveform generation, so that users don't experience long loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating waveforms THEN the system SHALL optimize for processing speed
2. WHEN processing audio files THEN the system SHALL provide progress feedback for long operations
3. WHEN generating waveforms THEN the system SHALL support asynchronous processing
4. WHEN multiple waveforms are requested THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent processing efficiently

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want comprehensive tests for critical functionality, so that I can rely on the package's stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the package THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for audio decoding
2. WHEN testing the package THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for waveform generation
3. WHEN testing the package THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for data processing
4. WHEN testing the package THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for memory management
5. WHEN testing the package THEN the system SHALL NOT include UI-specific tests
6. WHEN testing the package THEN the system SHALL verify error handling scenarios

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want to provide pre-generated waveform data to predefined views, so that I can easily display waveforms without regenerating them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing pre-generated waveform data THEN the system SHALL accept the data in the predefined views
2. WHEN using pre-generated data THEN the system SHALL validate the data format
3. WHEN displaying pre-generated waveforms THEN the system SHALL apply all customization options
4. WHEN using pre-generated data THEN the system SHALL support the same playback position functionality
5. WHEN providing invalid waveform data THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer, I want simple package integration, so that I can start using waveform functionality immediately after import.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the package THEN the system SHALL work without additional configuration
2. WHEN using the package THEN the system SHALL provide clear and simple API methods
3. WHEN integrating the package THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation
4. WHEN using the package THEN the system SHALL provide example implementations
5. WHEN importing the package THEN the system SHALL handle all necessary dependencies automatically
