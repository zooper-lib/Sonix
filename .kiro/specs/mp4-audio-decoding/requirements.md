# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive MP4 audio decoding support to the Sonix Flutter package. MP4 is a widely used container format that can contain various audio codecs, with AAC being the most common. This implementation will focus on AAC audio decoding within MP4 containers, following the same architectural patterns as existing decoders (MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG) with full chunked processing support for memory-efficient handling of large files.

The implementation will use a permissively-licensed native library for MP4/AAC decoding that allows the Sonix package to maintain its MIT license, integrate seamlessly with the existing isolate-based processing architecture, and provide the same level of functionality as other supported formats including real-time waveform generation, seeking capabilities, and comprehensive error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Flutter developer using Sonix, I want to decode MP4 audio files so that I can generate waveforms from MP4 content just like other supported formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an MP4 file path to SonixInstance THEN the system SHALL successfully decode the audio content
2. WHEN the MP4 file contains AAC audio codec THEN the system SHALL extract and decode the audio samples
3. WHEN the decoded audio is processed THEN the system SHALL return AudioData with correct sample rate, channels, duration, and sample data
4. IF the MP4 file is corrupted or invalid THEN the system SHALL throw appropriate DecodingException with descriptive error messages
5. WHEN MP4 decoding is complete THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all allocated native resources

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with large MP4 files, I want chunked processing support so that I can process files larger than available RAM without memory issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing chunked decoding for MP4 files THEN the system SHALL support ChunkedAudioDecoder interface
2. WHEN processing MP4 file chunks THEN the system SHALL return AudioChunk objects with correct sample positioning
3. WHEN seeking within MP4 files THEN the system SHALL provide accurate time-based seeking with SeekResult feedback
4. WHEN determining optimal chunk sizes THEN the system SHALL return ChunkSizeRecommendation based on MP4 format characteristics
5. WHEN chunked processing is complete THEN the system SHALL properly cleanup decoder state and resources
6. IF memory pressure thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with appropriate exceptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating Sonix, I want MP4 format detection and factory support so that MP4 files are automatically recognized and processed with the correct decoder.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AudioDecoderFactory.detectFormat is called with MP4 file THEN the system SHALL return AudioFormat.mp4
2. WHEN AudioDecoderFactory.createDecoder is called for MP4 format THEN the system SHALL return MP4Decoder instance
3. WHEN detecting MP4 format by file extension THEN the system SHALL recognize .mp4, .m4a file extensions
4. WHEN detecting MP4 format by content THEN the system SHALL recognize MP4 magic bytes (ftyp box signature)
5. WHEN listing supported formats THEN the system SHALL include MP4 in supported formats and extensions lists

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using native audio processing, I want MP4 decoding integrated into the native layer so that decoding performance is optimized and consistent with other formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN native bindings are initialized THEN the system SHALL support SONIX_FORMAT_MP4 constant
2. WHEN NativeAudioBindings.decodeAudio is called with MP4 data THEN the system SHALL use native MP4 decoder
3. WHEN native MP4 decoding occurs THEN the system SHALL return SonixAudioData with decoded samples
4. WHEN estimating memory usage for MP4 THEN the system SHALL provide accurate estimates based on AAC compression ratios
5. IF native MP4 decoding fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error codes and messages through existing error handling mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want comprehensive test coverage for MP4 decoding so that the implementation is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running unit tests THEN the system SHALL have tests for MP4Decoder covering all public methods
2. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test MP4 decoding with real MP4 files of various sizes and characteristics
3. WHEN running chunked processing tests THEN the system SHALL verify correct chunked decoding behavior for MP4 files
4. WHEN running error handling tests THEN the system SHALL test MP4-specific error conditions and edge cases
5. WHEN running format detection tests THEN the system SHALL verify MP4 format detection accuracy
6. WHEN running factory tests THEN the system SHALL verify MP4Decoder creation and format support
7. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL validate MP4 decoding performance meets acceptable benchmarks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with various MP4 files, I want robust error handling and validation so that the system gracefully handles edge cases and provides clear feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing empty MP4 files THEN the system SHALL throw DecodingException with clear error message
2. WHEN processing corrupted MP4 files THEN the system SHALL detect corruption and throw appropriate exceptions
3. WHEN processing MP4 files with unsupported codecs THEN the system SHALL throw UnsupportedFormatException
4. WHEN processing MP4 files without audio tracks THEN the system SHALL throw DecodingException indicating no audio content
5. WHEN MP4 files exceed memory limits THEN the system SHALL throw MemoryException with guidance to use chunked processing
6. WHEN native library errors occur THEN the system SHALL propagate error messages through existing exception hierarchy

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want MP4 implementation to follow existing architectural patterns so that it integrates seamlessly and maintains code consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing MP4Decoder THEN the class SHALL implement both AudioDecoder and ChunkedAudioDecoder interfaces
2. WHEN implementing native integration THEN the system SHALL follow existing FFI patterns and memory management
3. WHEN implementing error handling THEN the system SHALL use existing SonixException hierarchy
4. WHEN implementing file organization THEN MP4-related files SHALL be placed in appropriate directories following project structure
5. WHEN implementing documentation THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive code comments and API documentation
6. WHEN implementing constants and enums THEN the system SHALL extend existing AudioFormat enum and related utilities
