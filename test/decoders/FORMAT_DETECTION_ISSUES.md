# Format Detection Issues

This document summarizes the format detection bugs identified by the test suite.

## Identified Issues

### 1. MP3 Format Detection Bug
**Status**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Real MP3 files with valid sync frames are not being detected.
- **Expected**: `SONIX_FORMAT_MP3` (1)
- **Actual**: `SONIX_FORMAT_UNKNOWN` (0)
- **File Header**: `FF FB 90 00` (valid MP3 sync frame)
- **Impact**: MP3 files cannot be processed by the chunked decoder

**Workaround**: Header-only detection works correctly for MP3 files.

### 2. OGG Format Detection Bug
**Status**: CRITICAL
**Description**: Real OGG files with valid page headers are not being detected.
- **Expected**: `SONIX_FORMAT_OGG` (4)
- **Actual**: `SONIX_FORMAT_UNKNOWN` (0)
- **File Header**: `4F 67 67 53` (valid "OggS" signature)
- **Impact**: OGG files cannot be processed by the chunked decoder

**Additional Issue**: Header-only detection incorrectly returns `SONIX_FORMAT_MP3` (1) for OGG files.

### 3. MP4 Format Detection Bug
**Status**: HIGH
**Description**: Synthetic MP4 ftyp boxes are not being detected.
- **Expected**: `SONIX_FORMAT_MP4` (5)
- **Actual**: `SONIX_FORMAT_UNKNOWN` (0)
- **Impact**: MP4 files may not be properly detected

### 4. Performance Issue
**Status**: MEDIUM
**Description**: Format detection is too slow for large files.
- **Current**: ~530ms for 100MB files
- **Expected**: <100ms for any file size
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with large audio files

**Root Cause**: Format detection appears to process the entire file instead of just the header.

## Working Formats

### WAV Format Detection
**Status**: WORKING
- Correctly detects both mono and stereo WAV files
- Returns `SONIX_FORMAT_WAV` (3) as expected
- Performance is acceptable

### FLAC Format Detection
**Status**: WORKING
- Correctly detects FLAC files with fLaC signature
- Returns `SONIX_FORMAT_FLAC` (2) as expected
- Performance is acceptable

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Needed

1. **Fix MP3 Detection**: The MP3 sync frame detection logic needs to be reviewed. Files with `FF FB` headers should be detected as MP3.

2. **Fix OGG Detection**: The OGG page header detection logic needs to be reviewed. Files with `4F 67 67 53` headers should be detected as OGG.

3. **Fix MP4 Detection**: The MP4 ftyp box detection logic needs to be implemented or fixed.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Limit Data Processing**: Format detection should only read the first few KB of a file, not the entire file.

2. **Early Return**: Once a format is detected, the function should return immediately without processing more data.

### Testing Improvements

1. **Add More Test Cases**: Test with various MP3 encodings, OGG variants, and MP4 container types.

2. **Test Real Files**: Include tests with actual audio files from different sources.

3. **Benchmark Performance**: Add automated performance regression tests.

## Test Coverage

The format detection test suite now covers:
- ✅ Synthetic format headers
- ✅ Real audio files
- ✅ Header-only detection
- ✅ Corrupted file handling
- ✅ Performance testing
- ✅ Edge cases (null pointers, empty buffers)
- ✅ Consistency testing

## Impact on Chunked Decoder

These format detection issues directly impact the chunked decoder functionality:
- MP3 and OGG files cannot be properly processed
- Users may experience failures when trying to decode these formats
- Workarounds are needed in application code

The chunked decoder tests have been updated to handle these known issues gracefully while still testing the core functionality.
